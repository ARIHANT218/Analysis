# 🛠 Built With

This project is developed using **Python** and popular machine learning and NLP libraries to perform text classification tasks.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Python** 🐍 – Core programming language
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning library for model building and evaluation
* **Logistic Regression** – Baseline classification model
* **XGBoost (optional)** – Advanced boosting algorithm for better accuracy
* **NLTK** – Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing

## ⚙️ Features

* Preprocess text data using **NLTK** (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
* Build machine learning models using **Logistic Regression** and optionally **XGBoost**
* Train and evaluate models with **Scikit-learn** utilities
* Achieve improved accuracy with ensemble/boosting techniques

## 🔧 Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd <your-repo-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage

Run preprocessing:

```bash
python src/preprocess.py
```

Train Logistic Regression:

```bash
python src/train.py --model logistic
```

Train XGBoost (optional):

```bash
python src/train.py --model xgboost
```

Evaluate results:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

## 📊 Results

* Logistic Regression: Baseline accuracy
* XGBoost: Higher accuracy with boosting



## 📌 Requirements
